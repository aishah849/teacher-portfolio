        January - March 2019: Hwa Chong Institution (High School) As part of my
        PGDE, I did my Practicum at the High School section of Hwa Chong
        Institution, teaching Secondary 1 English Language and Literature (ELL)
        and Secondary 4 Biology under the school's Integrated Programme. This
        was a wonderful experience for me: I had the chance to return to my alma
        mater and teach under my former teachers who were now my mentors, and it
        was extremely meaningful. Working with Secondary 1 students (1A3 and
        1P3) was a refreshing experience: I had the privilege of starting them
        off on the Hwa Chong experience as their teacher, and I enjoyed the
        latitude and freedom I got to design lessons with a Language Arts
        curriculum (blending language and literature together). I also had the
        chance to teach Biology to the Secondary 4 students (4A1), doing
        practicals such as sheep liver dissections, and cow's eye dissections,
        in addition to theory lessons. The range of learner ages was a
        challenge, but I eventually learnt how to switch approaches while
        walking between classes! June - August 2018: Pioneer Primary School I
        spent part of my semester break during the PGDE in NIE interning at
        Pioneer Primary School in Jurong West. As a secondary school teacher (by
        training), I wanted to understand the primary school system and the
        teaching and learning conditions, in hope that I could better bridge the
        gap for the students when they come to secondary school. As part of my
        stint, I worked with Primary 5 classes taking Standard subjects, though
        I had the opportunity to work with the full range: the high-progress,
        mid-progress, and low-progress classes. I also had the chance to visit
        classes ranging from Primary 2 to Primary 5, observing the change in
        approaches and styles. Some of the highlights of my time here were
        taking the Primary 5 students to the National Education Preview for the
        National Day Parade, and helping to run the National Physical Fitness
        Awards (NAPFA) test for the Primary 5s. July - December 2017: Christ
        Church Secondary School I was posted to Christ Church Secondary School
        for my Untrained Teaching stint, just after returning home from my
        graduate studies while waiting for the NIE PGDE to begin. This was a
        very defining time in my journey as an educator: it was the first time I
        was given teaching responsibilities, including a form class (Secondary
        3E3) and a CCA (badminton). (I eventually returned to Christ Church
        while in NIE for the Teaching Assistantship practicum). The experience
        was extremely enjoyable: I had the opoortunity to work with a graduating
        batch of Secondary 5s preparing for their GCE O-Level examinations, as
        well as my own Secondary 3 form class, teaching English Language to
        both. I also worked with a Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) class for
        Science, an experience I treasure till today. For their Secondary 4
        Prepatory Programme, I was given the chance to work with a Secondary 3
        Normal Academic class for English Language, and I had the latitude to
        design my materials and implement them all by myself (and the sudden
        change of circumstances did warrant it). CCA-wise, I had a great time
        with the Badminton team, working with the team captains to plan and
        motivate their team, as well as helping to lead physical conditioning
        sessions under the main teacher-in-charge (a PE teacher). It was
        extremely satisfying to see the team in competition in January 2018 at
        the zonal level, where they really came together as one to fight for
        common goals. August 2013: Beatty Secondary School I was posted here for
        my School Attachment Programme, compulsory for all MOE scholarship
        holders. Here, I had the chance to work with a Secondary 3 Biology
        class, as well as cut my teeth (very memorably) planning a lesson (that
        eventually went dismally) with my Secondary 1 Normal (Technical) class.
        The latter was especially memorable because my mentor was supportive,
        but she intentionally let it fail within a safe space before debriefing
        me, and the lessons I drew from that experience are ones that I still
        remember. headquarters June - September 2015: Standards and Research
        Branch, Academy of Singapore Teachers During my final long semester
        break as an undergraduate, I interned with the Standards and Research
        Branch (SRB) of the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST). AST functions
        as the main professional development body within MOE, and I had the
        opportunity to hone competencies in educational research and teaching
        (through workshops conducted by Master Teachers and Principal Master
        Teachers). Working under the guidance of a Senior Specialist, I was able
        to gain insight into the work done by specialists in the education
        system, and the importance of continual professional development
        activities beyond initial teacher training.
